\title{von Neumann Neighbourhood Algorithm}
\usage{
neighbourhood_neumann(x, order)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the lattice grid for which a neighbourhood structure is required}

\item{order}{the order of the neighbourhood system}
}
\value{
a matrix, where each row corresponds to an observations neighbours
}
\description{
This functions computes the complete neighbourhood system of the qth order
for a lattice grid under the von Neumann algorithm
}
\examples{
 y <- matrix(sample(c(-1, 1), size = 16, prob = c(0.6, 0.4), replace = TRUE), nrow = 4)
 neigh <- neighbourhood_neumann(x = y, order = 1)
